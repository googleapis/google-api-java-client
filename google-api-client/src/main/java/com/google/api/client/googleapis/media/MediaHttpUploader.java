/**
 * Media HTTP Uploader, with support for both direct and resumable media uploads. Documentation is
 * available <a
 * href='https://googleapis.github.io/google-api-java-client/media-upload.html'>here</a>.
 *
 * <p>For resumable uploads, when the media content length is known, if the provided {@link
 * InputStream} has {@link InputStream#markSupported} as {@code false} then it is wrapped in an
 * {@link BufferedInputStream} to support the {@link InputStream#mark} and {@link InputStream#reset}
 * methods required for handling server errors. If the media content length is unknown then each
 * chunk is stored temporarily in memory. This is required to determine when the last chunk is
 * reached.
 *
 * <p>See {@link #setDisableGZipContent(boolean)} for information on when content is gzipped and how
 * to control that behavior.
 *
 * <p>Back-off is disabled by default. To enable it for an abnormal HTTP response and an I/O
 * exception you should call {@link HttpRequest#setUnsuccessfulResponseHandler} with a new {@link
 * HttpBackOffUnsuccessfulResponseHandler} instance and {@link HttpRequest#setIOExceptionHandler}
 * with {@link HttpBackOffIOExceptionHandler}.
 *
 * <p>Upgrade warning: in prior version 1.14 exponential back-off was enabled by default for an
 * abnormal HTTP response and there was a regular retry (without back-off) when I/O exception was
 * thrown. Starting with version 1.15 back-off is disabled and there is no retry on I/O exception by
 * default.
 *
 * <p>Upgrade warning: in prior version 1.16 {@link #serverErrorCallback} was public but starting
 * with version 1.17 it has been removed from the public API, and changed to be package private.
 *
 * <p>Implementation is not thread-safe.
