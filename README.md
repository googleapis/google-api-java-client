for accessing any HTTP-based API on the web, not just Google APIs.

 - Lightweight, efficient XML and JSON data models that support any data schema.
 - Support for [protocol buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf/).
 - A set of [generated libraries for Google APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-java-client-services#supported-google-apis).

## Supported Java environments

- Java 7 (or higher)
- Android 1.6 (or higher)
- [Google App Engine](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-java-client/wiki/App-Engine)

## Dependencies
This library is built on top of two common libraries, also built by Google, and also designed to
work with any HTTP service on the web:

- [Google HTTP Client Library for Java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-http-java-client)
- [Google OAuth Client Library for Java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client)

## Important Warnings

### @Beta

Features marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level are subject to change. They
might be modified in any way, or even removed, in any major release. You should not use beta features
if your code is a library itself (that is, if your code is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside
your own control).

### Deprecations

Deprecated non-beta features will be removed eighteen months after the release in which they are
first deprecated. You must fix your usages before this time. If you don't, any type of breakage
might result, and you are not guaranteed a compilation error.
